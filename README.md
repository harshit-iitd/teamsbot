# teamsbot
This bot was used to join online classes using Microsoft teams.

Your are just two steps away from joining online classes while you sleep in bed:
1) Download this folder in zip format. Copy the below lines and paste them in a new .env file which has to be created in the same directory:
USERNAME = *********
PASSWORD = *********
2) Update your time table in time_table.csv

And now you are good to go. Open terminal in the same directory and run the comman python3 teams.py
